I have chosen to collaborate with some partners (Action 1) because I believe that combining our expertise will lead to a more comprehensive and high-quality paper. As a team leader, I have access to a wide range of research topics and affiliations, but I also recognize the limitations of working alone. By collaborating with other experts in the field, we can pool our knowledge, share insights, and divide tasks efficiently. This approach will not only enhance the quality of the paper but also increase the chances of publication in top-tier journals.

As a team leader, I have already recognized the benefits of collaboration in my previous thought. Now that I have a team, I see no reason to change this approach. Collaborating with partners will allow us to share our expertise, divide tasks efficiently, and produce a more comprehensive paper. This is particularly important for a research project like ours, where we need to cover multiple topics such as data cube, attack graph, and data security.
