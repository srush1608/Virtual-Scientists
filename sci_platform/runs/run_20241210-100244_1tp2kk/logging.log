I have chosen to collaborate with some partners (Action 1) because I believe that it will lead to a more comprehensive and high-quality paper. As a team leader, I have experience working with my colleagues at the Naval Research Laboratory, College of William & Mary, and George Mason University on various projects related to data cube, attack graph, data mining, access control, and data security. Collaborating with others can bring diverse perspectives, expertise, and insights that can help strengthen our research.

Additionally, dividing tasks among team members can increase efficiency and productivity. By sharing the workload, we can ensure that each task is completed thoroughly and on time, which is essential for producing a high-quality paper. Moreover, combining our expertise will enable us to tackle complex challenges that might be difficult to overcome individually.
