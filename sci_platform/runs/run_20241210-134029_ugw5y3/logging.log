I have chosen to collaborate with some partners (Action 1) because I believe that combining our expertise will lead to a more comprehensive and high-quality paper. As a team leader, I have access to a wide range of research topics and affiliations, but I am aware that no single person can possess all the knowledge required to produce an outstanding paper. By sharing insights and dividing tasks with other experts, we can ensure that our paper covers all aspects of the topic thoroughly and accurately.

Moreover, collaborating with partners will also help us to identify potential gaps in our research and address them more effectively. This collaborative approach will not only enhance the quality of our work but also increase efficiency by leveraging each other's strengths and minimizing individual weaknesses.
