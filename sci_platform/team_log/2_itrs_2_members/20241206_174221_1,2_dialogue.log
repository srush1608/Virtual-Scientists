Epoch:0 | TOPIC | Scientist0:As the team leader, I'd like to propose a potential research topic that leverages our collective expertise and interests. Considering our affiliations with 'naval research aboratory', 'college of william and mary', and 'george mason univ.', we have a strong foundation in data security, access control, and data protection.

Scientist1's research on overlay networks and high-performance computing can be integrated with my own work on data cubes and attack graphs. We could explore the intersection of these areas, focusing on developing novel methods for secure and efficient data sharing across distributed systems.

One potential topic that comes to mind is: "Data Protection in Distributed Systems: A Novel Approach Using Attack Graphs and Data Cubes."

To make this research innovative and impactful, we can draw from our collective knowledge of data mining, access control, and data security. We could investigate how attack graphs can be used to identify vulnerabilities in distributed systems, and then develop a data cube-based approach to mitigate those risks.

Scientist133, what are your thoughts on this potential topic? Do you see any areas where we could improve or expand upon the idea?

Also, Scientist1, I'd love to hear your insights on how our research on overlay networks and high-performance computing could be integrated with our proposed topic.
